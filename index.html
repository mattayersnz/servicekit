      <h2> What is service? </h2>

    <div>
      <p>There is a story told in Christian tradition of a time when a man named Jesus did a small act that was totally surprising in his time and culture.</p>
      <p>Jesus was a man born in the Middle East in obscurity, who has now set the modern western calendar of BC and AD. He is understood by Christians as part of the character of God, a complex being who has formed all reality as we know it. So for Christians, the actions of this man are important.</p>
      <p>Jesus was an Israelite Rabbi, a respected teacher of his time. Rabbis would travel and teach with a group of people known as their disciples, those learning from their teaching. A Rabbi would hold a certain status in the community and therefore would be treated with honour. </p>
      <p>On this day the group had been travelling on dusty Israeli roads and it was evening. They had been wearing open sandals and it was time to clean their feet after the day’s journey. Typically the Rabbi would have someone clean his feet, but today was different. Jesus took up a towel and bowl and went around the disciples cleaning their feet. </p>
      <p>This story not only reveals a constant theme in the actions of Jesus over his life, but for Christians it reveals something of the character of God, and therefore reflected in humanity who were designed to image Him. </p>
      <p>Service is core to the human condition.</p>
      <p>But what is service?</p>
      <p>I think we know it when we see it, service being that focus on others, a care for them, their lives and situation. It is helping them in what they need.</p>
      <p>Where things get a little more complicated is when people serve together. With a growing group there are multiple people now with multiple needs to be served. </p>
      <p>The simple act of service to another person can get lost with a growing number of people serving together. In a community group, a company, a church, a government department. This can happen despite a desire to serve.</p>
      <p>For example, a modern company can involve many people beyond the customers that have needs to serve: the team, the families of the team, the shareholders of the company, and the community in which they operate. Often the needs of these different groups seem to be in opposition. </p>
      <p>Does the outward nature of service need to turn inward as the group of people grows? As more groups are added have needs to serve, is this where the focus must shift?</p>
      <p>There are a couple of things that can help this gravity of turning inward: a memory of the simple act of service that existed in the beginning, and a commitment to redesign any part of how the group works to orient back toward service.</p>
      <p>Firstly, as a group grows it is very easy to forget the simple act of service that existed in the beginning. There was a need, there was a way that helped that need. The group grew due to that need. Come back to that need, that simple story of service. Play it out over time, see how everything works together now in service to those with that need. </p>
      <p>Secondly, as a group grows there are new need that emerge from the different people that join. It is easy to lose the sense of why the group existed in the first place with all these new people and needs. This requires constant redesign of how the service looks. Go back to the simple story of service from the beginning, orient every aspect of the group to that end. </p>
      <p>Think about how people join the group? How they get paid? How the group makes money? How it shares money? How people grow in their skills? How what the group does changes over time? All of these needs can be served, but design it all in a way that doesn’t undermine the core people the group exists to serve. Even if it means going into a deeper understanding of their lives to uncover new insight into their needs to evolve how you serve them, and everyone else at the same time.</p>
      <p>For example, a cafe starts with the simple act of making a good cup of coffee for someone. Then a price for that coffee can be determined by the expense involved in having a good barrister to make the coffee, the coffee machine, ingredients, cafe space and supporting staff. The price of the coffee can be offset by other income from food or other services. The needs of staff to be paid can be met, the needs of equipment suppliers, and so on. This system of parts can become a more sophisticated service over time, but never forget the simple act of service: making someone a good cup of coffee.</p>
      <p>Service is an ongoing effort, but it all involves more service. And you can serve, it is what started it all in the first place.</p>
      <p>A simple act of service.</p>
