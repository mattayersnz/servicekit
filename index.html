      <h1> What is a Company? </h1> <br>

    <div x-show="open">
      <p>My two sons [4yo, 2yo] and I had just left home in the car. We were talking about the other cars on the road around us, and I mentioned that they had all been created by companies. There was a logo on each car to indicate the company that made them. We drove along spotting Toyotas and Audis, Mazdas and Mitsubishis.</p>
      <p>Then my oldest son said, "Papa, what is a company?".</p>
      <p>From my years back in business school, I knew that there were well formed responses to this question. But I also went to design school, and to my surprise I found that designers have an interesting take on creating a company.</p>
      <p>Here is what happened.</p>
      <p>I was heading into my final year of design school and heard of a new lecturer soon to arrive. A Brazilian man named Charles Bezerra.</p>
      <p>Charles was unassuming. He had an expression of curiosity, and way of conversation that indicated he really listened.</p>
      <p>He had been a professor at one of the top design schools in the world. One that worked at the intersection of design and business. The Illinois Institute of technology based in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Charles became my honours supervisor. And what I learned from him would influence what I would explore for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>Designers focus on form and function, understanding physical materials, environmental factors, and the nature and behaviour of people. It turned out that a company could be thought of as a group of people shaped by practices, environments and technology. All of which could be designed.</p>
      <p>A designer starts with those they serve, and anchored there, they get comfortable with the openness and unknowns that follow. This struck me as  different to what I heard in business school. In business school you learn a lot of 'best practices'. These are known, battle tested ways to build a business in a competitive market. In design school you learn to build things from scratch, you start with the people you want to serve, and then explore their lives from there.  You don't know yet where it will lead.</p>
      <p>In regards to a building company, the difference of approach between design and business school drives to the heart of what a company is, and what it becomes. Business school teaches to create in terms of business models, markets and industries. Design school teaches to create in terms of humanity, history and environment.</p>
      <p>This brings me back to my oldest son's question: "what is a company?"</p>
      <p>A business school response would be along the lines of this. "A company is a group of people who work together to create things that people buy, they compete against other companies and make money from being the best at what they do, for people and for the environment."</p>
      <p>While I drew a lot from business school, I found myself responding primarily from my formation in design school.</p>
      <p>I said, "Buddy, a company is a group of people who serve together. They think deeply about the people they serve, noticing their lives, their environment,  their hopes and needs. All these things help them know what to create."</p>
      <p>4yo listened to what I said and simply responded, "Ok Papa".  And as we continued on our way we discussed the design decisions that had been made by these company's who were serving these drivers.</p>
