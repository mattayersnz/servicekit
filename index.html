    <h2> What is service? </h2>

    <div>
      <p>There is a story told in Christian tradition of a time when a man named Jesus did a small act that was surprising for his time and culture.</p>
      <p>Jesus was born in the Middle East in obscurity, but has now set the modern western calendar of BC and AD. He is understood by Christians as part of the character of God, a complex being who has formed all reality as we know it. So for Christians, the actions of this man are important.</p>
      <p>Jesus was an Israelite Rabbi, a respected teacher of his time. Rabbis would travel and teach with a group of people known as their disciples. A Rabbi would hold a certain status in the community and therefore would be treated with honour. </p>
      <p>On this day the group had been travelling on dusty Israeli roads and it was evening. They had been wearing open sandals and it was time to clean their feet after the journey. Typically the Rabbi would have someone clean his feet, but today was different. Jesus took up a towel and bowl and went around the disciples cleaning their feet. </p>
      <p>This story not only reveals a constant theme in the actions of Jesus over his life, but for Christians it reveals something of the character of God, and is therefore reflected in humanity who were designed to image Him. </p>
      <p>Service is core to the human condition.</p>
      <p>But what is service?</p>
      <p>I think we know it when we see it, service being that focus on others, a care for them, their lives and situation. It is helping them in what they need.</p>
      <p>Where things get a little more complicated is when people serve together. With a growing group there are multiple people now with multiple needs to be served. Not only are there different needs now in the people being served, but also those that are serving have needs.</p>
      <p>The simple act of service to another person can get lost with a growing number of people serving together. In a community group, a company, a church, a government department.</p>
      <p>For example, a modern company can involve many people beyond the customers that have needs to serve: the team, the families of the team, the shareholders of the company, and the community in which they operate. Often the needs of these different groups seem to be in opposition. </p>
      <p>Does the outward nature of service need to turn inward as the group of people serving grows? As more groups are added have needs to serve, is this where the focus must shift?</p>
      <p>There are a couple of things that can help this gravity of turning inward: firstly, a memory of the simple act of service that existed in the beginning, and secondly a commitment to redesign any part of how the group works to orient back toward service.</p>
      <p>Firstly, as a group grows it is very easy to forget the simple act of service that existed in the beginning. There was a need, there was a way that helped that need. The group grew due to that need. Come back to that need, that simple story of service. Play it out over time, see how everything works together now in service to those with that need. </p>
      <p>Secondly, as a group grows there are new needs that emerge from the different people that join in the serving. It is easy to lose the sense of why the group existed in the first place with all these new people and needs. This requires constant redesign of how the service looks. Go back to the simple story of service from the beginning, orient every aspect of the group to that end. </p>
      <p>Start with the original need and service. Then in light of this, think about how people join in the serving in a way that enhances that service? Think about how they get paid in a way that enhances the original service? How the group makes money to sustain the service? How it shares money? How people grow in their skills? How what the group does changes over time? All of these needs can be served, but design it all to enhance the original service.</p>
      <p>For example, a cafe starts with the simple act of making a good cup of coffee for someone. This act of service can be improved with better equipment, and a price can be set so that you can continue to make cups of coffee based on what people can afford. Other people can join your act of service and offer addition things like good baking and other drink options. A space can be created to enjoy these things, and all could be financially sustained through prices that work for those you serve. All of these things can work together to enhance that simple act of service of making someone a cup of coffee, and what that coffee means for their day.</p>
      <p>Service is an ongoing effort, there will be more needs to serve over time. But it is all service. And you can serve, it is what started it all in the first place.</p>
      <p>A simple act of service.</p>

    <h2 class="actsOfService"> How to begin? </h2>

    <div>
      <p>Firstly, ask someone to walk to you a particular activity they do in a typical day that you would like to help them with. As they speak, ask them about the details: where do things happen? who is involved? what do they find helpful? what do they find challenging?</p>
      <p>Secondly, create a storyboard of the key moments in the activity that you want to help them with. Start with the thing that triggers them to begin the activity (an inspiration, a habit, a place, a challenge, etc), then the key steps involved in completing the activity. These key frames in the storyboard can become the focal points for improving your service over time, including working with others to serve. Stay focused on these key frames and improve the experience of each frame over time.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, create a little experiment to improve some part of how you serve. Make is easy to try, and quick to evaluate whether it is helpful.</p>
